# FairPoint  
**Think Sharper. Argue Smarter.**  

FairPoint is built to help people have better conversations, make stronger arguments, and think more clearly. Instead of letting bias or emotions take over, it helps users break down discussions logically and stay focused on what really matters. Whether it’s for debates, negotiations, or everyday discussions, FairPoint keeps things structured and balanced.  

## Features

- **Argument Breakdown** – Organizes conversations into claims, premises, and counterpoints for better clarity.  
- **Logical Fallacy Alerts** – Identifies weak reasoning so arguments stay solid.  
- **Graphical Argument Mapping** – Visually lays out discussions to highlight connections and gaps in logic.  
- **Structured Thinking Tools** – Provides step-by-step guidance for forming strong, well-reasoned arguments.
